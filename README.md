# zwart_lab_tools
A list of tools routinely used by the Zwart lab for genomics analysis and visualization

## Differential analysis <a name="differential analysis"></a>

For the basics differential binding and gene expression

**DESeq2 for differential gene expression of RNA-seq experiments:** [https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html]

**DiffBind for differential binding analysis of ChIP-seq experiments:** [https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DiffBind/inst/doc/DiffBind.pdf]

## Visualization of ChIP-seq data <a name="Visualization"></a>

**DeepTools for heamaps and profiles (linux server):** [https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/]

**EaSeq for heatmaps and profiles (Windows):** [https://easeq.net/]

## Visualization <a name="Visualization"></a>

**ggplot2 in R:** [https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/, https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html, http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-box-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization]

**ggpubr in R for statistics in your plot:** [https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/]


## Reviews <a name="reviews"></a>

These are not implementations as such, but contain useful pointers. Because review papers in this field are more time-sensitive, I have added the month of journal publication. Note that the original preprint may in some cases have been available online long before the published version.
