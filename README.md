A list of tools used by the Zwart lab for genomics analysis and visualizatoin


For the basics differential binding and gene expression
**DESeq2 for differential gene expression of RNA-seq experiments:** [https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html]

**DiffBind for differential binding analysis of ChIP-seq experiments:** [https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DiffBind/inst/doc/DiffBind.pdf]


This is a very nice conceptual review of how deep learning can be used in genomics. It explains how convolutional networks, recurrent networks, graph convolutional networks, autoencoders and GANs work. It also explains useful concepts like multi-modal learning, transfer learning, and model explainability.
