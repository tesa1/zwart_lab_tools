A list of tools used by the Zwart lab for genomics analysis and visualizatoin

## Differential analysis <a name="differential analysis"></a>

For the basics differential binding and gene expression

**DESeq2 for differential gene expression of RNA-seq experiments:** [https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html]

**DiffBind for differential binding analysis of ChIP-seq experiments:** [https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DiffBind/inst/doc/DiffBind.pdf]




## Reviews <a name="reviews"></a>

These are not implementations as such, but contain useful pointers. Because review papers in this field are more time-sensitive, I have added the month of journal publication. Note that the original preprint may in some cases have been available online long before the published version.
